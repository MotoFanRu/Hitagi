 *           1 = Suspend watchdog timer.
 * ; 01: WDBG, Watchdog DBUG Enable.
 *       Determines the operation of the WDOG module during DBUG mode. Write once-only.
 *           0 = Continue timer operation.
 *           1 = Suspend watchdog timer.
 * ; 02: WDE, Watchdog Enable.
 *       Enables or disables the WDOG module. enable once-only.
 *           0 = Disable Watchdog.
 *           1 = Enable Watchdog.
 * ; 03: WRE, Wdog_b or wdog_rst_b Enable.
 *       Determines if the watchdog will generate the reset signal or wdog_b upon a watchdog timeout or
 *       clock monitor event. Write once-only.
 *           0 = Generate a reset signal.
 *           1 = Generate wdog_b.
 * ; 04: SRS, Software Reset Signal.
 *       Controls the software assertion of the WDOG-generated reset signal.
 *       Note: This bit automatically resets to "1" after it has been asserted to "0".
 *           0 = Assert system reset signal.
 *           1 = No effect on system.
 * ; 05: WDA, Wdog_b Assertion.
 *       Controls the software assertion of the wdog_b signal.
 *           0 = Assert wdog_b output.
 *           1 = No effect on system.
 * ; 06: WOE, Wdog_b Output Enable.
 *       Determines if the WDOG pin is configured as an output or is input when GPIO gives WDOG ability to control
 *       this pinâ€™s direction after reset.
 *           0 = Pin is tri-stated.
 *           1 = Pin configured as output.
 * ; 07: Reserved. These bits are reserved for future expansion.
 *       Always read as zero and must be written with zeros for future compatibility.
 * ; 08: Reserved. These bits are reserved for future expansion.
 *       Always read as zero and must be written with zeros for future compatibility.

 * ; 14: Timer value (0x3F).
 * ; 15: Timer value (0x3F).
 *   WT[6:0], Bits 15-9, Watchdog Timeout Field.
 *       This 7-bit field contains the time-out value and is loaded into the Watchdog counter after the service
 *       routine has been performed. After reset, WT[6:0] must be written before enabling the Watchdog.
 *           Set to desired timeout value.
